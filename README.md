# Data_Mining_Clustering_Project

### The objective of this project is to cluster pixel values extracted from an image and stored in an Excel document. The aim is to group together similar pixel trios within the same cluster. (NB: each pixel trio represents an RGB code, thus, sections of the image with the same or similar colors should be in the same cluster)
